        <p class="govuk-body">The <a rel="external" href="https://roatp.apprenticeships.sfa.bis.gov.uk/download">register of apprenticeship training providers</a> is a list of organisations that are eligible to receive government funding to train apprentices.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">There are a few things you need to consider before <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/becoming-an-apprenticeship-training-provider">becoming a registered apprenticeship training provider</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="applying">Applying to the register of apprenticeship training providers</h2>

        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
          <li>Choose an application route.</li>
          <li>Check your eligibility.</li>
          <li>Read the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers#application-guidance">application guidance</a> to check you have everything you need.</li>
          <li>Apply using the <a rel="external" href="https://education.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.shtml">Department for Education portal (Bravo)</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="govuk-body">If your organisation is eligible and not currently listed on the register, you can apply. There is no deadline and the portal will remain open for applications.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">ESFA will start to assess applications on the first working day of each month for any applications received during the previous month. It usually takes around 12 weeks to assess an application, but it can sometimes take longer. We will keep you informed on the progress of your application.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">If your organisation is currently on the register, you will need to reapply. We will be inviting organisations to reapply in phases, during 2019.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">If your application is unsuccessful, we will provide feedback. You will be able to apply twice within a 12-month period.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="route">Choose an application route</h2>
  
        <p class="govuk-body">There are 3 application routes onto the register.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Main provider route</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">This is for providers who will directly deliver apprenticeship training for employers who use the apprenticeship service to pay for training. Providers that meet this requirement can also provide apprenticeship training to their own employees or those of connected companies and act as subcontractors for other providers.</p>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">This route is also for providers who provide apprenticeship training for employers who do not pay the apprenticeship levy. ESFA awarded these contracts in January 2018.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Employer provider route</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">This is for employers who will directly deliver training to their own employees or those of connected companies and use the apprenticeship service to pay for apprenticeship training. Providers that meet this requirement can also act as subcontractors.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Supporting provider route</h3>
        
        <p class="govuk-body">This is for organisations who will enter into subcontracts with main providers and employer providers to deliver apprenticeship training. This can be up to a maximum value of £500,000 per year in total. For organisations with no history of apprenticeship delivery according to recent records we hold, this is limited to £100,000 in their first year on the register.</p>
        
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="eligibility">Check your eligibility</h2>
