    <p class="govuk-body">We have sent your resubmitted application to the RoATP application assessment teams.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You will need to allow at least 12 weeks for us to process your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">It may take longer because this is a private beta service. We will send you an email when there’s an update with your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once your application’s assessed, your organisation will receive an outcome, a financial health grade and next steps.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Find out more about <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">financial health grades (opens in a new window or tab)</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you want to know more about how the teams currently assess applications, <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">read ‘section 7 what happens next’ (opens in a new window or tab)</a>. Some processes may differ, as this guidance is on the current Bravo service.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you have any questions, want to make a change or withdraw your application, email <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">roatp.support@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
