    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">We have sent your application to the following RoATP application assessment teams:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>gateway team - they assess your organisation, the people involved in your organisation and criminal and compliance checks</li>
      <li>financial health assessment team - they assess your organisation’s financial evidence</li>
      <li>assessor team - they assess the remaining application answers, policies and processes</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">If your application answers are unclear, we may ask for further information. You must reply within 5 working days or we may withdraw your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">You will need to allow at least 12 weeks for us to process your application. It may take longer because this is a private beta service. We will send you an email when there’s an update with your application.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Once your application has been assessed, your organisation will receive an outcome, a financial health grade and next steps.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Find out more about how your organisation is assessed for <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">financial health (opens in a new window or tab)</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you want to know more about how the teams currently assess applications, how outcomes and financial health grades are given and next steps you can <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">read ‘section 7 what happens next’ (opens in a new window or tab)</a>. Some processes may differ, as the guidance is based on the current Bravo service.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you have any questions, want to make a change or withdraw your application, email <a href="javascript:preventDefault();">roatp.support@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body"><a href="#">What did you think of this service? (takes 30 seconds)</a></p>
